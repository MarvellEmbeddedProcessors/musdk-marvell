Networking Management Proxy (NMP) Guest User Guide
============================================

Introduction
------------

When NMP is enabled, user application is running as a guest. It means that the user application is not managing the network element
but only retrieve an access to the networking objects and uses them mostly for the standard and basic run-time operation like sending
and receiving frames and/or enqueuer and dequeue frames to/from encryption/decryption.

When a user application is starting, it should register itself to the NMP as a guest with a unique guest-ID.
The guest than, will get a file with the specific description of the specific guest networking elements that are available for it.
The description is passed from the NMP as a text file (specifically as in JSON format).
