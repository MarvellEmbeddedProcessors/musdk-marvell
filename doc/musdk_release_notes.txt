MUSDK Release Notes
===================
Marvell User-Space SDK (MUSDK) is a light-weight user-space I/O driver for Marvell's
Embedded Networking SoC's. The MUSDK library provides a simple and direct access to Marvell's
SoC blocks for networking applications and networking infrastructure.

.. Note::
	The MUSDK package is still in development and only partially tested.
