MUSDK Release Notes
===================
Marvell User-Space SDK (MUSDK) is a light-weight user-space I/O driver for Marvell's
Embedded Networking SoC's. The MUSDK library provides a simple and direct access to Marvell's
SoC blocks for networking applications and networking infrastructure.

Notes:
------
- This is an Alpha-level engineering drop of MUSDK package.
- The package is only partially tested, user should expect all kinds of issues.
- The package was tested in Little-Endian mode only.
