Packet Processor Classifier (CLS) User Guide
============================================

Introduction
------------
MUSDK Classifier and applications are part of the MUSDK package.

MUSDK Classifier provides the capability of configuring the Packet Processor HW Classifier Engine
for user-space applications.

Feature Set
-----------

Supported API's
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- pp2_cls_tbl_init
	- pp2_cls_tbl_deinit
	- pp2_cls_qos_tbl_init
	- pp2_cls_tbl_add_rule

	- pp2_cls_tbl_modify_rule
	- pp2_cls_tbl_remove_rule

General Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- This release supports only 5-tuple classification
	- Default queue can not be set from MUSDK API. The default queue is taken from Kernel configuration. For
	  configuring the default queue, please refer to PPv2.2 Kernel Module Parameters chapter.
	- By default, MUSDK supports only one Traffic Class (TC). For configuring multiple TC's, the kernel driver
	  needs to be configured with multiple queues. For confifuring multiple queues (up to 8), please refer to
	  PPv2.2 Kernel Module Parameters chapter.
	- MUSDK classifier database and Kernel database are not synchronized yet, therefore there is no support for
	  simultaneous updates in Kernel/User Space.
	- Maskable engine was added to the version, although not all capabilities were tested (see 4.3 Classifier
	  pre-defined capabilities below). Some of the capabilities may not work properly.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- It is possible to add new flows even if the same flow was just added
	- After MUSDK is initialized, it is not possible to add more flows through Kernel (i.e. through sysfs)
	- The musdk_cls_demo application supports configuration of only a single port at a time


Functional Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- The 'musdk_cls_dbg' example application allows for configuring 5 tuples table in PPv2 classifier, as well as
	  to configure MAC address filtering and VLAN filtering.
	- Performs all required initializations, using the MUSDK API's.
	- Includes an "echo" mode allowing to loopback traffic sent to the specific port openned. This allows for
	  testing the configured feature.
	- The following ports are supported:
		- ppio-0:0 - CP0-port0 (10G), in A7040/A8040.
		- ppio-0:1 - CP0-port1 (1G), in A7040.
		- ppio-0:2 - CP0-port1 (1G), in A8040.
		- ppio-0:2 - CP0-port2 (1G), in A7040.


Feature Description
-------------------
The Armada A70x0/A80x0 contains a Parser unit and a Classifier unit.

Parser Unit
~~~~~~~~~~~
The Parser unit performs configurable pipelined parsing for interleaved arriving packets. The Parser unit identifies
the packet header and forwards the results to the classifier controller.

The parser's main role is parsing, identification of the networking protocol stack and passing indications to the Classifier block.
Packet processing for all networking ports is done with a single TCAM with flexible configuration and partitioning,
through several lookup iterations.

Following is a list of default parsing fields:
	- Single and double VLAN tagged packets (ether type 0x8100 and 0x88a8)
	- Ether type parse - includes:
		- ARP (0x0806)
		- IPV4 (0x0800, non-opt and opt, no PPPoE and over PPPoE)
		- IPV6 (0x86dd, no PPPoE and over PPPoE)
		- unknown ether type
	- L4 info parse - includes:
		- Both TCP and UDP including IPV4 non-frag and frag
		- unknown L4 info
	- PPPoE parse: (ether type 0x8864)
	- IGMP parsing
	- Broadcast, unicast (MTM and non-MTM), multicast parse

Classifier Unit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Classifier unit performs packets classification. Packets classification is done based on the parsing results
received from the Parser and on lookups performed by the various classification engines.

The Classifier determines the various actions required for the packet: **Drop** or **Set target queue**.
These actions are transferred to the RX FIFO.

The following steps are taken in each packet classification:
	- Select classification flow according to Lookup ID and physical Port ID.
	- Issue lookup commands as defined by the classification flow.
	- Execute lookup commands by the search engines.
	- Resolve the classification attributes in priority order.

The classification engines consist of the following:
	- Maskable: the Maskable Engine provides TCAM based lookup for a key and generates the required
	  actions based on the lookup results
	- Exact Match: the Exact Match engine performs lookup of a key in an internal
	  preconfigured database (Exact Match Search Engine)
	- RSS: The RSS engineâ€™s task is to enable statistical load balancing between multiple cores

- The task of the classification engines is to perform the lookups and generate the resulting actions to the actions resolver
- The action resolver resolves the received actions and generates the Classification results

.. note::
	1. All entries which are defined as Maskable may also be configured as exact match engine
	2. Only one table may be defined
	3. Not all combinations were tested

QoS
---------
Quality of Service is supported in classifier. The QoS maps traffic types to queues.

The following traffic types are supported:
	- VLAN priority:	QoS according to VLAN-priority (outer tag) if exists; otherwise, use default
	- IP-ToS priority:	QoS according to IP-priority (i.e. DSCP) if exists; otherwise, use default
	- VLAN_IP priority:	QoS according to VLAN-priority (outer tag) if exists;
				otherwise, use IP-priority (i.e. DSCP) if exists; otherwise, use default
	- IP_VLAN priority:	QoS according to IP-priority (i.e. DSCP) if exists;
				otherwise, use VLAN-priority (outer tag)  if exists; otherwise, use default
