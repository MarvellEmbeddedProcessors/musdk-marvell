Management Queue Allocator (MQA) User Guide
===========================================

Introduction
------------

The Management Queue Allocator (MQA) module provides service that enable creating and configuring queues
which can be associated to each other and passed to other MUSDK modules such as the GIU and NMP.
The module creates a common descriptor for it's queues which is used and updated by other modules.

When the module is initialized, it sets up 4 tables used to describe and setup a queue.
 - Global Consumer Table (GCT) - A descriptor table that describes the queue for the consumer side
 - Global Producer Table (GPT) - Same for the producer side
 - Global Notification Consumer Table (GNCT) - A u16 table that contains the queue consumer index
 - Global Notification Producer Table (GNPT) - Same table for producer index

Each MQA queue is identified by a unique 16-bit queue-id. The queue-id is the index of the queue's descriptors
in the 4 tables above. Essentially, each time the MQA allocates a queue, it sequentailly allocates a queue-id and
updates the appropriate locations in the above tables.

The GCT and GPT tables holds basic information on the queue such as descriptor ring physical and virtual address,
the ring size, the ring element size, interrupt information, etc. They also contain the addresses to be used in the
GNCT and GNPT. Everytime a queue processing node consumes/produces elements in a queue it updates the consumer/prodcuer
index which is located in the GNCT/GNPT	tables.
