 * If you received this File from Marvell, you may opt to use, redistribute and/or

 * General Public License Version 2.1 plus the following FreeRTOS exception.
 * An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on
 * FreeRTOS.
 * Clause 1:
 * Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
 * combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
 * General Public License cover the whole combination.
 * As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission
 * to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS solely
 * through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms of these
 * independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined work
 * under terms of your choice, provided that:
 * 1. Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that
 * details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself
 * to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have
 * made) should the recipient request it.
 * 2. The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related
 * product.
 * 3. The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to
 * FreeRTOS and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present in
 * FreeRTOS.
 * Clause 2:
 * FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including
 * the publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the
 * express permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the
 * industry and is intended to ensure information accuracy).
